Ncdu is a disk usage analyzer with a text-mode user interface. It is designed to find space hogs on a remote server where you donâ€™t have an entire graphical setup available, but it is a useful tool even on regular desktop systems. Ncdu aims to be fast, simple, easy to use, and should be able to run on any POSIX-like system.
