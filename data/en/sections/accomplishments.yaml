  timeline: "Jan 2025 - May 2025"
  organization:
    name: Boot.dev
    url: https://www.boot.dev
  courseOverview: "Multiple courses to get me started on learning Python.

- name: Learning about GIT and CI/CD
  timeline: "March 2025"
  organization:
    name: Boot.dev
    url: https://www.boot.dev
  courseOverview: "Another course at boot.dev. I can only confirm that a subscription to this website was a bit of a higher cost, but definitely worth the investment! To prepare myself to add more value at work and help out our senior techleads finetune our service, I decided to dive into CI/CD and Git. This completely energized me to see how cool those tools are with version control and unit testing. I genuinly enjoyed this course a lot. Definitely tackling the followup course on GIT to deepdive!"

  courseOverview: "While Redteaming can be exciting (depending on the scope), I always had a preference for blueteaming, strengthening systems, learning and applying general cybersecurity concepts AND logs! Lots of logs!! I was a system engineer when I wanted to explore more about cybersecurity, following this course and setting up a Splunk SIEM at home was my first step."
