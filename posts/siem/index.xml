&lt;p&gt;==================================================================================&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="executive-summary"&gt;Executive summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cato Networks logs stopped ingesting into Splunk following a customer-initiated unannounced maintenance. Investigation revealed that the API connection for log retrieval was interrupted, requiring manual intervention to restore service. The incident highlighted the impact of uncoordinated maintenance activities on log ingestion stability. Immediate checks were performed on the Heavy Forwarder logs, and the scripted input was reset to restore log flow. No other log sources were found to be affected at this time.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>SIEM data onboarding</title><link>https://siemforge.xyz/posts/siem/data-onboarding/dataonboardingpost/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 17:17:23 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://siemforge.xyz/posts/siem/data-onboarding/dataonboardingpost/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="siem-data-onboarding-best-practices-and-a-deepdive-into-splunk-vs-microsoft-sentinel"&gt;SIEM data onboarding: Best practices and a deepdive into Splunk vs Microsoft Sentinel&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id="executive-summary"&gt;Executive summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) platforms are only as effective as the data they receive. SIEM data onboarding is the process of getting the right logs, in the right format, into the SIEM so it can detect threats, support incident response, and demonstrate compliance. Simply “sending some logs” is not enough; quality, completeness, and normalization drive the value you get from your SIEM investment.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
